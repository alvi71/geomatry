    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold ">Question no 4: What is call-back function ? What is the purpose of this function ? </h2>
    <p class="text-2xl font-semibold">answer: A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution.We need callback functions because many JavaScript actions are asynchronous, which means they don't really stop the program (or a function) from running until they're completed, as you're probably used to. Instead, it will execute in the background while the rest of the code runs. </p>
